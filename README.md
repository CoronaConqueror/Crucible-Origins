# Crucible-Origins
 This is a game that I have been developing on and off over several months.

I used the SDL2 library to develop it. It includes an entity-component system that I am still expanding upon. I have spent the majority of the time refactoring the game to better implement that system. Currently, you can launch the game and move Omni around with WASD and shoot his gun with SPACEBAR.

I have plans of finishing it, however I am currently trying to finish my Bachelors Degree, so I do not have much time to work on it.

To try out my game, feel free to get a branch running on Visual Studio.
